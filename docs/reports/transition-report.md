**Utility and Transfer Report**
Here is an example of the contents of the docs/reports/transition-report.md file, formatted in Markdown. I based it on the information from your meeting with the customer: you discussed the details, decided to limit yourself to a simple site without the Telegram bot and mini-app, and this is the end of the project. Since the full transcript and recording were not provided, I created a fictional transcript based on your description - in reality, replace it with the actual one. The report is structured by the task points, with a neutral and factual tone, as it can be handed over to the customer. Add the file to the repository.

**Utility and Transfer Report**
Product Completeness
The product is considered complete within the revised requirements. The main part is completed: development of a simple site. Not implemented: Telegram bot and mini-app, since following the meeting with the customer, it was decided to abandon these components to simplify the project. Thus, the project is completed at the site stage, without additional integrations.

**Customer Product Usage**
The customer is not using the product yet, as development has just finished and the transition has not occurred. Reasons: waiting for final handover and testing. After delivery, it is planned to use it for demonstration or basic purposes, but without regular operation.

**Deployment of the product on the customer's side**
The customer has not yet deployed the product on their side. This is planned after receiving the final version and deployment instructions.

**Measures for full handover**
For full handover of the product, it is necessary to:

**Transfer the source code and all related files via the repository.**
Conduct a training session on how to use the site (if required).
Provide access to documentation (README.md) with updated sections.
Confirm functionality through a test deployment.
Customer plans after delivery
The customer plans to use the site as a stand-alone product without further development. They do not intend to continue working on it on their own. Collaboration with the team is not planned, as the project is being completed at the current stage. The terms for potential continuation were not discussed, as the focus is on completion.

**Next Steps in Development (Final Delivery)**
Next Step: Final delivery of the site via updated repository, updated README with additional sections for customer feedback, and confirmation of acceptance. This will ensure post-delivery usefulness by adding recommendations for support and potential improvements.

**How to increase the chances of post-delivery usefulness**
Add maintenance and future improvement sections to the README for self-help.
Recommend regular updates to site dependencies.
Provide team contacts for possible post-delivery consultation.
Customer feedback on README
During the meeting, the README was reviewed together.

Is everything clear? Yes, the main part is clear, but the deployment instructions could be clarified.
What could be improved? Add more code samples and visual diagrams.
Can they run/deploy as instructed? Yes, but the additional sections would make it easier.
Two additional sections the customer wants to include in the README: "Service Guide (for customer)" and "Ideas for Future Improvements (for customer)".
